Assumptions For Tobins Rover
----------------------------
* The text entered into a program follows a strict grammar. The parser is intolerant to violations of that grammar. 
* Rovers are fire and forget. Once you drop them on the surface, they won't be re-programmed.
* Rovers die if they go out of bounds. The don't "bounce" of the bounds or intelligently re-orient themselves.
